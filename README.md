TODO: Snazzy graphic

Choices, explanations, and documentation around if I were to build a startup web app

Unless stated or seen otherwise, this was all written in roughly May 2023

TODO: Fill in tl;dr with more info as we decide on things
TODO: Have this act as a table of contents

1. First, MVP product without web app
2. Then:
- No Docker
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap?? Tailwind??
- React but not for HTTP
- runbook as documentation
- Hosting provider selection

## Introduction
Hello dear reader! I'm not sure who you are, but I'm glad you're here!

As stated above, this is documentation around a theoretical scenario of myself making all the decisions and explorations for setting up a web app for a startup in roughly May 2023.

I've provided context at the bottom of this document, but that's not why you're here. Let's dig in.

## Context
NCX and I have decided to part ways. This will likely finalize at the end of May 2023.

I've had some lingering architectural questions that I feel would best be solved through exploration.

Additionally, the last time I publicly documented my architectural preferences and setup was through open sourcing Find Work in December 2019. And as expected in hindsight, these have aged alright -- not bad but not great either.
