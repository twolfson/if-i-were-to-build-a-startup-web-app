## Context
NCX and I have decided to part ways. This will likely finalize at the end of May 2023.

I've had some lingering architectural questions that I feel would best be solved through exploration.

Additionally, the last time I publicly documented my architectural preferences and setup was through open sourcing Find Work in December 2019. And as expected in hindsight, these have aged alright -- not bad but not great either.
