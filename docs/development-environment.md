# Development Environment Analysis
## Description
Web apps run on a computer either locally or on a machine from a provider, or somewhere in-between.

For development, there's a bunch of choices around "how" to accomplish this -- and the shape of the web app may inform/force certain choices.

## Machine Comparison
These choices aren't necessarily exclusive, and it does become personal preference (so a team might support a variety), but when starting it'll be me and I tend to stick to 1 type most of the time.

|          Name          | Non-trivial previous experience? |                               Description                               |                                                 Notes                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Local machine (winner)**         | ✔️ (majority)                    | Develop on your local computer                                          | Best experience I've had since there's no lag, and no jumping through hoops for functionality/features |
| Personal cloud machine | ✔️ (lightly)                     | Develop on an instance specifically for you                             | This works alright, but the remote development environment can be laggy and tooling can feel limited (though modern toolkits are getting way better I believe ([VS Code example](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview))).<br/><br/>Benefits include easy integration to existing VPC setups, but when starting those usually aren't needed                                                                                                       |
| Shared cloud machine   | ✔️ (yes, but never exclusively)  | Everyone shares an environment (e.g. `beta`, `staging`) for development | Every time I've had this, I always have local development as well - and I lean into that because there's no fear of collisions of work.<br/><br/>Benefits tend to include being a downstream scrubbed replica of production more easily                                                                                                      |
| Production only        |                                  | Everyone shares the same production environment                         | I've thankfully never had to experience this. Very risky due to edits affecting people using application                                                           |

## Containment Comparison
The choices aren't mutually exclusive, they can be combined as needed/wanted -- and some may be redundant with machine choice (e.g. virtual environments on a cloud machine)

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No containment                                                              | ✔️ (half of career-ish)          | Nothing isolating dependencies on the machine | This only happens with languages which use system-wide dependencies by default (e.g. Python and `pip`). It's risky if it's your local computer, because dependencies for unrelated things (e.g. an IDE tool) may conflict with your application's ones |
| **Language level (e.g. [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def), [node_modules](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/folders)) (winner)** | ✔️ (majority)                    | Isolate dependencies through folders          | Provides sane isolation without concerns of something unrelated unexpectedly leading to conflict,<br/>as well as ability to easily inspect and adjust dependencies if needed (rare)<br/><br/>For non-built-in (e.g. Virtual Environments), there's an extra lift of always invoking the shell wrapper (e.g. `bin/activate`) (unless shell auto-invokes)but OS level has similar drawbacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| OS level (e.g. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/))                                                                    | ✔️ (half of career-ish)          | Isolate entire OS through either a container or full VM                                               | As close as possible to production environment, if not 1:1 due to using same solution in production.<br/><br/>In practice, it's rare that an OS-specific issue is seen again in production (unless you develop on Windows and interface with paths)<br/><br/>Drawbacks include needing to enter the container shell every time and deal with folder mounting/isolation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
