# Explorations
Through the process of writing out this repository, we had times where we wanted to sanity check thoughts or possibly test various ideas.

This is a high level summary of what we explored and what we learned

## 1. django-contrib-auth-forms
Folder: [explorations/django-contrib-auth-forms](../explorations/django-contrib-auth-forms)

As mentioned in [Web Framework Analysis](web-framework.md), I believed that Django had strong out of the box auth support. I'm learning that's technically true, with a big asterisk.

The drawback is the Django auth content is largely configured for internal only users by default. And fighting against that is kind of sticky/annoying.

> Django is still ahead of others with a User model standard and permissions to use out of the gate. e.g. Rails still offers [Devise][] but it's an implied rather than explicit standard. [Passport (JS)][] is entirely handwaving over how users get defined/set up.

[Devise]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-user-authentication-with-devise-in-a-rails-7-application#step-4-creating-the-user-model-with-devise
[Passport (JS)]: https://www.passportjs.org/howtos/password/

<!-- TODO: Update web-framework to give more points to other repos due to best option prob being a third party library in all cases -->

To elaborate further:

- User creation is only done through CLI or Django Admin, no forms/views/URLs to extend for your app
    - User creation methods: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#creating-users
    - Enumerated provided forms/views: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#using-the-views
- The only articles I found for user creation extend the form that's only used by Django Admin's "Add User" page
