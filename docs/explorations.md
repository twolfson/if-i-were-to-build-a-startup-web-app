# Explorations
Through the process of writing out this repository, we had times where we wanted to sanity check thoughts or possibly test various ideas.

This is a high level summary of what we explored and what we learned

## 1. django-contrib-auth-forms
Folder: [explorations/1-django-contrib-auth-forms](../explorations/1-django-contrib-auth-forms)

As mentioned in [Web Framework Analysis](web-framework.md), I believed that Django had strong out of the box auth support. I'm learning that's technically true, with a big asterisk.

The drawback is the Django auth content is largely configured for internal only users by default. And fighting against that is kind of sticky/annoying.

> Django is still ahead of others with a User model standard and permissions to use out of the gate. e.g. Rails still offers [Devise][] but it's an implied rather than explicit standard. [Passport (JS)][] is entirely handwaving over how users get defined/set up.

[Devise]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-user-authentication-with-devise-in-a-rails-7-application#step-4-creating-the-user-model-with-devise
[Passport (JS)]: https://www.passportjs.org/howtos/password/

<!-- TODO: Update web-framework to give more points to other repos due to best option prob being a third party library in all cases -->

To elaborate further:

- User creation is only done through CLI or Django Admin, no forms/views/URLs to extend for your app
    - User creation methods: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#creating-users
    - Enumerated provided forms/views: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#using-the-views
- The only articles I found for user creation extend the form that's only used by Django Admin's "Add User" page
    - Article: https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2017/02/18/how-to-create-user-sign-up-view.html
    - Django Admin usage: https://github.com/django/django/blob/4.2.1/django/contrib/auth/admin.py#L74
- So that's only user creation (aka sign up), and probably the worst offender
- But dealing with the other ones feels like you're fighting the system rather than using a framework
    - There's limited/no documentation for the field names for the forms, which isn't good for custom styling
        - e.g. Login interfaces with [`username` and `password`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/4.2.1/django/contrib/auth/forms.py#L205-L210) but that's not in the docs
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView
        - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/auth/default/#django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm
    - On logout, you're navigated to a Django Admin page (until you set `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` in `settings.py`)
    - and the "Log in again" URL navigates to Django Admin, not the /login route set up

![Django default logout page](screenshots/explorations/1-django-contrib-auth-forms/default-logout-screen.png)

My theory on why this is the set up, is [Django is quite upfront about its history](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/):

> Django was invented to meet fast-moving newsroom deadlines, while satisfying the tough requirements of experienced web developers.

With a newsroom model, I'd wager the data model is oriented around internal users, not self-serve sign up (guessing this was pre-paywall days).

Maybe someone else has further clarity though.

I did get sign up and login working though, so that was nice.

There was also circuitous learning around Django forms themselves for me (majority of past work has been [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)) but I still don't have full resolution on the good and bad (especially on a trivial app).

# 2. django-allauth
Folder: [explorations/2-django-allauth](../explorations/2-django-allauth)

This went **a lot** smoother than the `django.contrib.auth` counterpart. It wasn't an instant setup still, but it had reasonable docs, discoverable code, and never felt like I was fighting it (though it did confuse me/feel unintuitive sometimes).

The good:
- Lots of functionality which I can opt-in to using for the most part
    - e.g. Can do just sign up + login, then add email verification, then add more
- Intuitive and legible code

The bad:
- Opinions are just different from mine around UX for a web app at times
    - `"mandatory"` email confirmation page does not identify user until verification is completed (so can't tell user the email to go check)
        - This is prob easily updated through a `views.py` override
    - The confirm email page doesn't show `messages` from what I can tell
- `urls`, `views`, and `templates` naming not consistent, so a lot of reading to find what `template` you need to update

Notable:
- When using `email` as login identifier and allowing `first_name` auth, `username` defaults to `first_name`
    - I've realized that this is a feature, not a bug though. On social platforms, people identify in URLs through `username`, which is distinct from `email`
- `@verified_email_required` does not redirect people to a different page, instead the prompt is just served from the same page

Recommendations:
- Copy all templates into your folder to start
    - Why: Overrides are inevitable for content changes, both in terms of styling as well as text (copy)
- Enumerate all form fields upfront in your own `forms.py`
    - Why: The docs don't state this, so it's a bit of digging to get them. I've found digging is a context switch though
- Enumerate all template <> views or URL mappings upfront (same reason as forms)
- Enumerate all URLs and selectively disable to get startup running ASAP
    - i.e. Prob don't need change password or email at the start, but sign up + login + verify email seem good to have
- Set up `Site` and `SocialApp` configurations via migrations, to easily cover all environments
- `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = "mandatory"` requires updating 5 pages (i.e. confirmation prompt + reset password flow)
    - Consider using `"optional"` with convention around `@verified_email_required` instead

# 2.1. What to Explore Next
We've spent **a lot** of time learning with these past 2 explorations, and am nervous about spinning my wheels further on explorations that don't necessarily provide large insights.

Though technically, the last 2 were quite invaluable -- just it took a lot of polish in the end to feel like I understood them more/less.

And I'd be somewhat nervous to push a less experienced person in that direction since the path to success feels somewhat narrow =/ (e.g. must be comfortable reading library source code to know how to extend it).

Still, I think a large goal of this repo is to derisk what a good architecture can be, while I still have Django + React experience in my working context.

So let's enumerate:

- Using Django forms in a robust manner (e.g. onboarding flow, so it's close to CRUD but not quite)
    - Decision: Should explore
    - Why: Helps us understand approachability of Django forms for myself and implied future eng
- Django with sessions only, with full page render + routing handled by React
    - Using django-allauth for auth backends
    - Using API endpoints or DRF for everything else
    - Decision: Should not explore
    - Why: We've worked with a comparable setup so are not too concerned about unknowns
    - Pros:
        - Full expression through React
        - No context switching once in UI (e.g. HTML + CSS building vs CSS + JS building)
        - Declarative UI so no UI management (albeit widgets are simple)
        - Using same session as Django Admin, allowing tooling like "Login As"
    - Cons:
        - React is rebuilding UI for anything we were "batteries included" on (e.g. auth -- we did rewrite template but that's better than building request handling + routing)
        - Writing out API serializers + React queries + React query state handling for every data model
            - i.e. Every new model would require:
            - Django Model + Django View + **DRF Serializer + React Query (incl caching logic) + React Query State handling** + React UI
                - Bold is what I consider excess
            - vs
            - Django Model + Django View + Django Form + Django Template + Interactive UI
                - Technically Django Form is 1:1 to DRF Serializer here, but if we're just rendering content, then it wouldn't be done
- React hydration with Django
    - We anticipate this being kind of gnarly but are curious what it looks like
    - Decision: On the fence
    - Why: It could be really clean and simple, but we doubt it
    - Mini-exploration:
        - Yea, no -- this seems to be exclusively for SSR where content should be 1:1
        - https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot#hydrating-server-rendered-html (https://archive.ph/lhmMm)
- Django somehow with React SSR
    - Mini-exploration:
        - This artcile captures an idea well, https://divyanshsingh2098.medium.com/server-side-rendering-with-react-node-js-and-django-944bafdf7e80 (https://archive.ph/WGHnH)
    - Unfortunately it sounds awful on paper
    - i.e. It has the same exact drawbacks as React doing full-page render
    - React would still need to make DB queries (either directly ðŸ¤® or through Django), or Django needs to guess what React needs
    - Decision: No

Okay, so stepping back, I think this uncovers some pretty core truths:

- The development experience on batteries included pages is quite different from it on freely built ones
    - i.e. If I'm building an onboarding flow, I'm working from scratch and need to content with Django Forms and Django Templates
    - whereas with the batteries included ones, I did too -- but it wasn't writing it from scratch
- In our experience, Bootstrap and imperatively built widgets do work well for their purpose, but it's kind of an architecture exercise every time you built one
    - whereas with React, it was always sane due to its declarative nature
    - Scenario: If I want to build a map selection page with a dynamically updating acreage count and a confirmation modal that changes based on DB state,
    - then I'd be writing a lot of imperative logic in jQuery (a la Bootstrap) or an imperative JS system
    - whereas React is quite intuitive and sane due to its declarative nature
- The only big pain point with React would be managing DB query state
    - i.e. Loading + handling submission errors is fine, and prob even better in React due to having context for things like modals
- So maybe there's a solution here where:
    - Use a common CSS framework for both UIs
    - If the page is "batteries included", use Django's functionality as needed
    - Otherwise, load it as a React page - including 404s
    - Con: We still need to figure out how to avoid DB cache handling because models to interact given a large enough app size
- OR:
    - Keep the UI simple from an interactivity piece (difficult to predict)
    - and build in Django templates + widget oriented UI

- Reading some articles to see if cache handling is avoidable
- Could disable caching through `cacheTime: 0`, https://github.com/TanStack/query/issues/99 (https://archive.ph/vYAWH)
- I'm not sure they're making the point well, but it does seem like we could just use no key for queries and sidestep caching, https://christopherkade.com/posts/react-query (https://archive.ph/Uzglm)
- Interesting insight in some places using a `setState` to track queries, which is prob just React Query with no key and more work, https://alto.com/blog/post/react-query-for-managing-server-state (https://archive.ph/KzQ6p)

- So maybe that's an exercise worth exploring (though these things tend to break only when app is at large scale and you're developing against it regularly)

- That being said, I'm also recalling a large painpoint of building out lots of serializer nesting, just for serving an API response
- Whereas in theory a Django view and Django template would be accessing exactly what they need (and no concerns of leaking too much data)

- Ah, for serializers, after applying some thought:
- If it's a read only page like a dashboard, we can either just serialize without a serializer (duh)
- or build a separate file to track the serializers just for that piece with all its nesting

- Okay, so something to explore:
- Site setup with auth on Django + remaining content using React
    - Pages to include:
        - Auth (Django): Login + sign up + confirm email
        - Post-Auth (React): Dashboard of outer content (e.g. organizations) + CRUDL inside each (e.g. tasks (classic))
            - Dashboard should show task count, and thus invalidate on task modification
        - Find a common UI system to build against (prob Bootstrap or Tailwind due to experience with them)

- Generally curious exploration: Is there some way to use React where it uses HTML form submission?
    - Decision: No
    - Why: Not worth it, not a realistic scenario - since we lose error handling

- This is all kind of a time sink at a point, and we do have other obligations, so prob not going to work on this actively until later

- TODO: Distill all this content down somewhat? Or put into a different file? It's quite rambly

- To reframe the dilemma:
- There are 2 ways to build a UI for an application:
- Either limit the designs upfront, and say "no" a lot more to functionality, but have a widget oriented implementation
- or
- Use a declarative system like React, but deal with all the consequences of that (e.g. large JS bundles, maintaining a serializers system + its headaches)
    - Serializers can either be page-centric or model-centric
    - Model-centric is way more reuseable
    - buuut... hmmmm... maybe there is something to reconsider with page-centric serializers?
        - TODO: Page-centric or maybe action-centric serializers exploration? Sidesteps caching concerns entirely (not even a common thing really)
            - TODO: This is prob along the spectrum of RPC vs REST, https://nordicapis.com/whats-the-difference-between-rpc-and-rest/
            - Looking at https://stackoverflow.com/a/55718066/1960509 - Realizing RPC would still have same headaches as REST with reuse across serializers -- prob exacerbated even due to keys being less clear =/
                - e.g. If an onboarding form + settings form use same model, then we're talking to that endpoint twice
                - buuut maybe this is find in practice and saner to develop against (e.g. handling one-offs)
                - I dunno, needs more time/thought

- What I don't recommend is something in-between:
- AJAX forms have little value add (e.g. there might be a loading spinner, but then need to handle error state -- ideal in-form since that's better UX)
- [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) also offer little value (i.e. click a page/submit a form, and content swaps instead of

- React is unavoidable to either deal with hydration (and thus code split if Django is backend -- as well as querying Django anyway)
- or just make a lot of requests on page load
- I do not recommend trying to be clever and stating a bunch of data to be parsed at load time
- We can do this with some nice things like who is the user so content like nav might instantly render, but it's neat + extra content to maintain rather than critical

- Looking at React Query code we've worked with, there are def only a few key painpoints that are now obvious how to resolve:
    - For models, avoid nesting them in each other unless explicit opt-in from client, so client can then know what/how to track things
    - For CRUDL, use a utility to manage eager adds and what not
    - On **any** modification, invalidate dashboards
    - Set data with response from API (or invalidate it immediately)
    - Do not deal with JWT and tokens if you can, lean into sessions already handled from initial page load. These will also get free `Set-Cookie` header responses to always stay fresh
