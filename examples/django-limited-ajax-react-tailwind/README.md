This is an example implementation in [if-i-were-to-build-a-startup-web-app](https://github.com/twolfson/if-i-were-to-build-a-startup-web-app)

At the time of writing, it's strictly a test to sanity check some setup elements for how the latest Tailwind framework interfaces with a Django setup, since it our existing interactions have required build step to filter unwanted content.

Additionally, it should serve as an explanation and example of the "limited AJAX" example we discussed in [docs/ui-server-interface.md](../../docs/ui-server-interface.md).
